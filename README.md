# Deduplication-and-feature-importance
Made an end-to-end data science project for deduplication on the NOMAO dataset, which consists of information on restaurants collected from online reviews. The pipeline consisted of preprocessing steps, followed by feature importance and calculating similarity index between two resturants which determine how similar are the two resturants.
